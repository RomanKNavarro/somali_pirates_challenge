# Somali Pirates!
# The SS Gustav makes an annual journey across the Indian Ocean to export goods.
# Before making it's next voyage, you, the captain, want to install a 360Â° auto-
# turret to defend against Somali pirates that the SS Gustav encountered numerously
# on it's previous voyages.

'''Given the speed of the Somali pirates in kph, program the turret to detect them
from a specific distance, fire warning shots as they close in, and sink/disable
them once a specific boundary has been reached. For Somali pirates travelling at
30 kph or less, program the turret to detect them from a distance of X meters,
where X is 6 times the kph at which they travel. The turret should give a volley
of three warning shots for every 10 meters they close in on the ship. Once they reach
a 60 meter boundary, the auto turret will begin firing at the Somali ship itself.
If they are travelling at a faster rate, then program the turret to detect them from
a distance of Y meters, where Y is 4 times their kph. A 5 warning shot volley will be
given for every 12 meters they close in. The Somali Pirates will be fired at once a
110 meter boundary has been reached. In both cases, 3 more volleys are fired to
sink/disable the ship once the respective boundary has been crossed. Return the
(whole) number of total volleys of warning shots, and the total amount of the warning
shots themselves.'''
